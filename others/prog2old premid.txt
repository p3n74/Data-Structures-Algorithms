Sum of Odd
by Gran Sabandal

Write a function that calculates the total of odd numbers in a collection. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of elements and the values of each element. The program should then display all the elements and the total of the odd numbers.

 

Sample Output 1

Enter how many values: 5
Enter the element 1: 1
Enter the element 2: 2
Enter the element 3: 3
Enter the element 4: 4
Enter the element 5: 5
List {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
The sum of odd is 9.
Sample Output 2

Enter how many values: 5
Enter the element 1: 2
Enter the element 2: 4
Enter the element 3: 6
Enter the element 4: 8
Enter the element 5: 10
List {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
The sum of odd is 0.
Sample Output 3

Enter how many values: 5
Enter the element 1: 1
Enter the element 2: 3
Enter the element 3: 5
Enter the element 4: 7
Enter the element 5: 9
List {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
The sum of odd is 25.

Average of Even
by Gran Sabandal

Write a function that calculates the average of even numbers in a collection. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of elements and the values of each element. The program should then display all the elements and the total of the even numbers and the average.
Sample Output 1

Enter how many values: 5
Enter the element 1: 1
Enter the element 2: 2
Enter the element 3: 3
Enter the element 4: 4
Enter the element 5: 5
List {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
The sum of even is 6.
The average of even is 3.00.
Sample Output 2

Enter how many values: 5
Enter the element 1: 2
Enter the element 2: 4
Enter the element 3: 6
Enter the element 4: 2
Enter the element 5: 1
List {2, 4, 6, 2, 1}
The sum of even is 14.
The average of even is 3.50.
Sample Output 3

Enter how many values: 0
List {}
The sum of even is 0.
The average of even is -nan.

The breaker
by Gran Sabandal

You are tasked with creating a program that helps find the missing number in an array of consecutive integers. Your program should take an array of integers as input and determine the missing number within the consecutive sequence.

 

Requirement: Implement a function that would return the missing number from the collection.

Sample Output 1

Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter element: 1
Enter element: 2
Enter element: 3
Enter element: 5
Enter element: 6
The missing number is: 4
Sample Output 2

Enter the size of the array: 3
Enter element: 1
Enter element: 3
Enter element: 4
The missing number is: 2
Sample Output 3

Enter the size of the array: 1
Enter element: 2
The missing number is: 1

Reverse Trap
by Gran Sabandal

You are tasked with creating a program that reverses the elements in an array. Your program should ask the user to enter the size of the array and its elements (all positive). Once the array is inputted, your program will reverse the order of the elements in the array.

 

Full credit is granted for the challenge takers.

 

Requirement: Implement as a function that would return a new array in reverse.

Challenge: Use the concept of storing the elements using a sentinel value (sentinel value can be any value <= 0) like in strings that a '\0' is appended at the end but nor part of the string.

Sample Output 1

Enter the size of array: 5
Enter element 1: 10
Enter element 2: 20
Enter element 3: 30
Enter element 4: 40
Enter element 5: 50
Original array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Reverse array: [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
Sample Output 2

Enter the size of array: 4
Enter element 1: 1
Enter element 2: 3
Enter element 3: 5
Enter element 4: 7
Original array: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Reverse array: [7, 5, 3, 1]
Sample Output 3

Enter the size of array: 6
Enter element 1: 8
Enter element 2: 46
Enter element 3: 41
Enter element 4: 34
Enter element 5: 65
Enter element 6: 63
Original array: [8, 46, 41, 34, 65, 63]
Reverse array: [63, 65, 34, 41, 46, 8]

ValenTIME: We don't need a space.
by Gran Sabandal

In the realm of myth and desire, where love transcends the boundaries of the mundane, there exists a tale of lovers who yearned for each other but were forever denied the luxury of physical closeness. Theirs was a love that defied gravity, yet gravity itself conspired against them. As you uncover the story you come across a door with scripture written: “For love knows no boundaries, not even those written in stardust.” You tried to open it but instead a loud voice echoed: Only those who can uncover the puzzle may seized the price.

 

HINT: Create a function that efficiently removes all whitespace characters from a given string returning as a new string. The program should prompt the user to enter a string and then process it, eliminating all spaces, tabs, and line breaks. Finally, it should display the modified string as the output.

 

You can use any string and ctype functions.

 

Sample Output 1

Enter a string: HELLO   WORLD
Modified string: HELLOWORLD
Sample Output 2

Enter a string: hello team
Modified string: helloteam
Sample Output 3

Enter a string: 5555 1
Modified string: 55551




Sum of Two numbers

Given an array of integers, return an array of two integers whose sum is equal to the number input
Array: [1,2,3,4,5]

Enter a number: 9
9 is the sum of 4 and 5
